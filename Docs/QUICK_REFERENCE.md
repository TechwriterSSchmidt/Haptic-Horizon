# Quick Reference Guide: Haptic Horizon

*Your silent sixth sense for navigation. Simple, intuitive, and discreet.*

> **Concept:** This device translates the physical world into vibration patterns ("Hapticons"). It behaves organically: lift it to scan, lower it to walk, drop it to sleep.

## 4. Safety Features

### Drop Alarm
If you drop the device, it will detect the freefall and impact. After 5 seconds of silence (to let you find it), it will start buzzing loudly so you can locate it by sound/vibration.

### Selfie Finder
If you lose the device, use a standard Bluetooth "Selfie Remote" to trigger the "Find Me" alarm.
